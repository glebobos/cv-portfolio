# How to Use This Resume Template

Welcome to your new resume template! This document is designed to be easily customizable. All personal and specific professional information has been replaced with placeholders. Follow the steps below to populate it with your own data.

## Getting Started

1.  **Review the Structure:** This resume is broken down into several markdown files located in the `resume/sections/` directory. Each file corresponds to a specific section of your resume (e.g., `experience.md`, `education.md`).

2.  **Edit Each Section:** Open each `.md` file in a text editor and replace the placeholder text with your own information. The placeholder text is designed to guide you on the type of information needed for each entry.

    *   **Placeholders:** Look for text like `[Your Name]`, `[Your Job Title]`, `[Company Name]`, `[University Name]`, etc. Replace these with your actual details.
    *   **Instructions:** Each file contains comments or instructions at the top to help you fill out that specific section.

3.  **Update the Summary:** The `summary.md` file is the most important one to edit. It contains your name, contact information, and professional summary. Make sure to fill this out completely.

4.  **Add Your Photo:** To add your own photo, replace the placeholder image at `resume/images/avatar.jpg` with your own image. Make sure the filename is `avatar.jpg` or update the path in `summary.md`.

5.  **Customize Sections:** You can add, remove, or rename sections to fit your needs. Simply create or delete the corresponding `.md` file in the `resume/sections` directory.

## Important Notes

*   **Data Management:** This project exclusively uses Markdown files for content management. All data is sourced from the `.md` files in this directory.
*   **Keep the Formatting:** Try to maintain the markdown formatting (e.g., headings, bold text, bullet points) to ensure the resume renders correctly.
*   **Be Concise:** Aim for clear and concise descriptions of your experience and skills.
*   **Proofread:** Once you've filled everything out, be sure to proofread the entire resume for any spelling or grammar errors.

Good luck!
